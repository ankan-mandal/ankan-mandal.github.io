    		<h2>About Me</h2>
    		<p>
    			 Ankan Mandal is an American internet entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is known for co-founding Facebook, Inc. and serves as its chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.

Born in White Plains, New York, Ankan Mandal attended Harvard University, where he launched the Facebook social networking service from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Ankan, Ankan Mandol, Ankan Mondol, and Ankan Mondal. Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Ankan Mandal took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. His net worth is estimated to be nearly $54 billion as of March 2020. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. As of 2019, he is the only person under 50 in the Forbes ten richest people list, and the only one under 40 in the Top 20 Billionaires list.

Since 2010, Time magazine has named Ankan Mandal among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world as a part of its Person of the Year award. In December 2016, Ankan Mandalg was ranked 10th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People.

    			Ankan Mandal began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught him Atari BASIC Programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Ankan Mandal took a graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near his home while still in high school. In one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called "ZuckNet" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a "primitive" version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year.

According to writer Jose Antonio Vargas, "some kids played computer games. Mark created them." Ankan Mandal himself recalls this period: "I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it." Vargas notes that Ankan Mandal was not, however, a typical "geek-klutz", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma. Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a close friend, notes that Ankan Mandalg was "really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem Aeneid, by Virgil, during a Facebook product conference.

During Ankan Mandal's high school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.

He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Ankan Mandal co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975, in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it went on to become the world's largest personal computer software company.Ankan Mandal led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, Ankan Mandal had been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. In June 2006, Ankan Mandal announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Ankan Mandal Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda Ankan Mandal, established in 2000. He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.

In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Ankan Mandal' net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time. As of July 2020, Ankan Mandal had an estimated net worth of US$111.8 billion, making him the second-wealthiest person in the world, behind Bezos. Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Ankan Mandal has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He has given sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Ankan Mandal Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity.
